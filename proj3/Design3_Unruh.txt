			PAGE TABLE MANAGEMENT
			=====================

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A1: In a few paragraphs, describe the existing code for locating the
>> frame, if any, that contains the data of a given page.

The code that was there to start used  the function "lookup_fd". 
This function takes a handle and returns a file descriptor from the
current thread. The handle is used to search through the thread's list of
file descriptors and returns the file descriptor at the matching handle.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A2: When two user processes both need a new frame at the same time,
>> how are races avoided?

When a new frame is allocated, we call palloc_get_page which handles race conditions.
We also acquire a lock before getting a new frame, and release it afterwards.

		       PAGING TO AND FROM DISK
		       =======================

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B1: When a frame is required but none is free, some frame must be
>> evicted.  Describe the algorithm used to choose a frame to evict.

The algorithm should call page_out which checks on the status of the frame.
Such as whether it is dirty, or has recently been accessed.
(pagedir_is_dirty and pagedir_is_accessed).

>> B2: Explain your heuristic for deciding whether a page fault for an
>> invalid virtual address should cause the stack to be extended into/trh
>> the page that faulted.

Check on things such as if the size of the file is larger than the stack.
As we're writing the file in to each page, if we run out of room in the stack,
we should allocate another page.


			 MEMORY MAPPED FILES
			 ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

We didn't change or add any struct but used the mapping struct:

struct mapping
  {
    struct list_elem elem;      /* List element. */
    int handle;                 /* Mapping id. */
    struct file *file;          /* File. */
    uint8_t *base;              /* Start of memory mapping. */
    size_t page_cnt;            /* Number of pages mapped. */
  };

  The purpose of this struct was to represent a mapping to physical memory.
  This way we wouldn't need to locate the data in physical memory every time,
  but rather, could just use the mapping struct to access the physical memory
  and save information about it.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> C2: Describe how memory mapped files integrate into your virtual
>> memory subsystem.  Explain how the page fault and eviction
>> processes differ between swap pages and other pages.

Memory mapped files are used when we need to access something in physical memory.
So like before a page is deallocated, for instance, we see if the pages are dirty
and if so, write to the physical memory based on where the mapping tells us before
deallocating the page memory.

>> C3: Explain how you determine whether a new file mapping overlaps
>> any existing segment.

We believe we should use the function page_dir_get_page
to see where the address is found and make sure it is within
the page table.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> C4: Mappings created with "mmap" have similar semantics to those of
>> data demand-paged from executables, except that "mmap" mappings are
>> written back to their original files, not to swap.  This implies
>> that much of their implementation can be shared.  Explain why your
>> implementation either does or does not share much of the code for
>> the two situations.

Our code that writes back to the original files uses a similar principle
as swap, but it uses the write_file_at function rather than block_write
in order to write to the file at the memory mapped location.



			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems
>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

I thought it was quite challenging, but not impossible to understand.
Took a decent amount of time to understand my part, which was the unmap function.
But I feel as though I learned a lot through figuring it out.

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

Yes, working on the system call to unmap helped me understand how the
data is mapped back to physical memory.

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

It took a long time to set up pintos from the original pintos3 directory
we were given, so it would be nice to not have that overhead and just get
into the project. But other than that, it seemed alright.

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
>> students, either for future quarters or the remaining projects?

I haven't interacted with the TA this semester, but I think as far as
general qualifications, the TA should have a good understanding of what's going on
in operating systems and be able to understand aspects of the code in detail.

>> Any other comments?
